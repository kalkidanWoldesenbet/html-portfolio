<h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm <strong>Kalkidan Abebe</strong>, a Junior Web Developer with a strong passion for
    building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences. I recently
    earned my <strong>Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science</strong> in July 2025, and since then,
    I've been focused on sharpening my skills in front-end and back-end development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy turning ideas into functional digital products and continuously learning
    new technologies to improve my craft. Whether it’s creating engaging UI layouts,
    optimizing performance, or exploring new frameworks, I love the process of bringing
    a project to life.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm excited to grow as a developer, collaborate with other creatives, and take on
    projects that challenge me to learn and innovate.
